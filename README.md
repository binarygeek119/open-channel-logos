# open-channel-logos
this repository is for open free to use channel logos.
<br><br><br>
all logos in here must not be copyrighted © or Trade Mark ™ content. so no a&e abc fox logos anything made by you. i will allow anything but XXX logos and real channels.
<br><br><br>
if you supply a logo to the repository
you are giving up all right to it. it will become open source or free to use.
this work must be family friendly. if you have adult only logos you must put any of them in a folder named Adult, then the sub folders like shows movies etc.
adult logos include bad words or not appropriate for younger viewers. there will be no XXX channel logos.
if you dont like this you may clone/fork this repository for XXX logos only. send a message to me and i link to it but i will not provide XXX logos.
<br>
i have also relaexed image of celebrities and recreations of logos. meaning you can use them in your logos. but still can't be a real channel. the prefect example of this is my [open swim]  logo a parody of [adult swim]. i made from scratch but modeled it after a real logo. please be aware if i get a please remove from someone big and scary (copyright owners) it will be removed asap.
